#### Dataset Structure
The dataset is stored in Parquet format with the following columns:
- `image_path`: Path to the original image
- `faces`: List of detected faces, each containing:
  - `bbox`: Bounding box coordinates [x1, y1, x2, y2]
  - `confidence`: Face detection confidence score
  - `is_eyeglasses`: Boolean indicating if glasses were detected
  - `eyeglasses_conf`: Confidence score for glasses detection
  - `thumbnail`: Base64 encoded face thumbnail

#### Usage Example
```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load the dataset
dataset = load_dataset("Manireddy1508/glasses-detection-dataset")

# Access the data
for item in dataset['train']:
    print(f"Image: {item['image_path']}")
    for face in item['faces']:
        print(f"  Face confidence: {face['confidence']:.2f}")
        print(f"  Has glasses: {face['is_eyeglasses']}")
        print(f"  Glasses confidence: {face['eyeglasses_conf']:.2f}")
```

#### Source Data
The original images were sourced from the Wikipedia-based Image Text (WIT) dataset and processed using:
- YOLOv8 for face detection
- CLIP for glasses classification
- Custom face verification heuristics

#### License
This dataset is provided under the same license as the original WIT dataset.

## Models

### YOLOv8n-face
- Used for face detection
- Lightweight and fast
- Included in the repository

### CLIP (ViT-B/32)
- Used for glasses classification
- Downloaded automatically
- Stored in safetensors format

## Face Verification

The pipeline includes a two-step face verification process to ensure high-quality face detection:

### Initial Verification
- Minimum face size: 100x100 pixels
- Edge margin: 10% from image boundaries
- Maximum face size: 80% of image dimensions
- Aspect ratio: Between 0.5 and 2.0

### Advanced Verification (FaceFilter)
- Additional size validation
- Aspect ratio verification (0.5 to 2.0)
- Contrast check (minimum threshold of 20)
- Grayscale analysis for quality assessment
- Early rejection of invalid faces

## Logging

All operations are logged to:
- Console output
- `glasses_detection.log` file

## Performance

- Face detection: ~30ms per image (on GPU)
- Glasses classification: ~50ms per face (on GPU)
- Batch processing supported for better throughput
